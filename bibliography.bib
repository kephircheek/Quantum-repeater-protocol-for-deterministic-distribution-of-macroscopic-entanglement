Although sufficient conditions have been formulated for the physical resources required to achieve quantum computation and communication, there is a growing understanding of the power of quantum measurement combined with the conditional evolution of quantum states for accomplishing diverse tasks in quantum information science. For example, a protocol has recently been developed for the realization of scalable long-distance quantum communication and the distribution of entanglement over quantum networks. Here we report the first enabling step in the realization of this protocol, namely the observation of quantum correlations for photon pairs generated in the collective emission from an atomic ensemble. The nonclassical character of the fields is demonstrated by the violation of an inequality involving their normalized correlation functions. Compared to previous investigations of non-classical correlations for photon pairs produced in atomic cascades and in parametric down-conversion, our experiment is distinct in that the correlated photons are separated by a programmable time interval (of about 400 nanoseconds in our initial experiments).},

  abstract = {Entanglement is a key feature in quantum information science and plays an important role in various applications of quantum mechanics. Fickler et al. (p. 640) present a method for converting the polarization state of photons into information encoded into spatial modes of a single photon. From this, superposition states and entangled photons with very high orbital angular momentum quantum numbers were generated. A method to entangle photons with very-high‚Äìorbital angular momentum quantum numbers advances quantum information science. Single photons with helical phase structures may carry a quantized amount of orbital angular momentum (OAM), and their entanglement is important for quantum information science and fundamental tests of quantum theory. Because there is no theoretical upper limit on how many quanta of OAM a single photon can carry, it is possible to create entanglement between two particles with an arbitrarily high difference in quantum number. By transferring polarization entanglement to OAM with an interferometric scheme, we generate and verify entanglement between two photons differing by 600 in quantum number. The only restrictive factors toward higher numbers are current technical limitations. We also experimentally demonstrate that the entanglement of very high OAM can improve the sensitivity of angular resolution in remote sensing.},

  abstract = {An optical cavity enhances the interaction between atoms and light, and the rate of coherent atom-photon coupling can be made larger than all decoherence rates of the system. For single atoms, this 'strong coupling regime' of cavity quantum electrodynamics has been the subject of many experimental advances. Efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by trapping the atom and cooling it towards the motional ground state; the latter has been achieved in one dimension so far. For systems of many atoms, the three-dimensional ground state of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Although experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have been reported recently, coupling BECs to cavities that are in the strong-coupling regime for single atoms has remained an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, made possible by combining a fibre-based cavity with atom-chip technology. This enables single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments with a simplified set-up and realizes the situation of many atoms in a cavity, each of which is identically and strongly coupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a single antinode of the standing-wave cavity field; we demonstrate that this gives rise to a controlled, tunable coupling rate. We study the heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the coupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting, which we attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure. We anticipate that the system will be suitable as a light-matter quantum interface for quantum information.},

They have been used in diverse experiments involving low-dimensional quantum gases, cavity quantum electrodynamics, atom-surface interactions, and chip-based atomic clocks and interferometers. However, a severe limitation of atom chips is that techniques to control atomic interactions and to generate entanglement have not been experimentally available so far. Such techniques enable chip-based studies of entangled many-body systems and are a key prerequisite for atom chip applications in quantum simulations, quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Here we report the experimental generation of multi-particle entanglement on an atom chip by controlling elastic collisional interactions with a state-dependent potential. We use this technique to generate spin-squeezed states of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate; such states are a useful resource for quantum metrology. The observed reduction in spin noise of -3.7 +/- 0.4 dB, combined with the spin coherence, implies four-partite entanglement between the condensate atoms; this could be used to improve an interferometric measurement by -2.5 +/- 0.6 dB over the standard quantum limit. Our data show good agreement with a dynamical multi-mode simulation and allow us to reconstruct the Wigner function of the spin-squeezed condensate. The techniques reported here could be directly applied to chip-based atomic clocks, currently under development.},

Quantum connectivity between nodes is achieved in the conceptually most fundamental way-by the coherent exchange of a single photon. We demonstrate the faithful transfer of an atomic quantum state and the creation of entanglement between two identical nodes in separate laboratories. The non-local state that is created is manipulated by local quantum bit (qubit) rotation. This efficient cavity-based approach to quantum networking is particularly promising because it offers a clear perspective for scalability, thus paving the way towards large-scale quantum networks and their applications.},

We show that the communication efficiency scales polynomially with the channel length, and hence the scheme should be operable over very long distances.},

Previous studies show that the key rate of point-to-point QKD is limited by a secret key rate capacity bound, and higher key rates would require quantum repeaters. In 2018, the seminal twin-field (TF) QKD protocol is proposed to provide a remarkable solution to overcoming the linear secret key capacity bound. This article presents an up-to-date survey on recent developments in this area, including the security proofs of phase-matching QKD and other TF-QKD type protocols, the theoretical examinations of these protocols under realistic conditions, and the recent experimental demonstrations.},

  abstract = {Quantum communications promises reliable transmission of quantum information, efficient distribution of entanglement and generation of completely secure keys. For all these tasks, we need to determine the optimal point-to-point rates that are achievable by two remote parties at the ends of a quantum channel, without restrictions on their local operations and classical communication, which can be unlimited and two-way. These two-way assisted capacities represent the ultimate rates that are reachable without quantum repeaters. Here, by constructing an upper bound based on the relative entropy of entanglement and devising a dimension-independent technique dubbed 'teleportation stretching', we establish these capacities for many fundamental channels, namely bosonic lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing and erasure channels in arbitrary dimension. In particular, we exactly determine the fundamental rate-loss tradeoff affecting any protocol of quantum key distribution. Our findings set the limits of point-to-point quantum communications and provide precise and general benchmarks for quantum repeaters.},

But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.},

One of the key challenges for implementing a quantum network is to distribute entangled flying qubits to spatially separated nodes, at which quantum interfaces or transducers map the entanglement onto stationary qubits. The stationary qubits at the separated nodes constitute quantum memories realized in matter while the flying qubits constitute quantum channels realized in photons. Dedicated efforts around the world for more than 20 years have resulted in both major theoretical and experimental progress toward entangling quantum nodes and ultimately building a global quantum network. Here, the development of quantum networks and the experimental progress over the past two decades leading to the current state of the art for generating entanglement of quantum nodes based on various physical systems such as single atoms, cold atomic ensembles, trapped ions, diamonds with nitrogen-vacancy centers, and solid-state host doped with rare-earth ions are reviewed. Along the way, the merits are discussed and the potential of each of these systems toward realizing a quantum network is compared.},

We show that this environment is effectively separated into a set of individual proximal 13C nuclear spins, which are coupled coherently to the electron spin, and the remainder of the 13C nuclear spins, which cause the loss of coherence. The proximal nuclear spins can be addressed and coupled individually because of quantum back-action from the electron, which modifies their energy levels and magnetic moments, effectively distinguishing them from the rest of the nuclei. These results open the door to coherent manipulation of individual isolated nuclear spins in a solid-state environment even at room temperature.},

Moreover, nuclear spin qubits could be well isolated from the electron spin, even during optical polarization and measurement of the electronic state. Finally, coherent interactions between individual nuclear spin qubits were observed and their excellent coherence properties were demonstrated.

Quantum interference in the detection of a photon emitted by one of the samples projects the otherwise independent ensembles into an entangled state with one joint excitation stored remotely in 10(5) atoms at each site. After a programmable delay, we confirm entanglement by mapping the state of the atoms to optical fields and measuring mutual coherences and photon statistics for these fields. We thereby determine a quantitative lower bound for the entanglement of the joint state of the ensembles.

  abstract = {Quantum communication is a method that offers efficient and secure ways for the exchange of information in a network. Large-scale quantum communication (of the order of 100 km) has been achieved; however, serious problems occur beyond this distance scale, mainly due to inevitable photon loss in the transmission channel. Quantum communication eventually fails when the probability of a dark count in the photon detectors becomes comparable to the probability that a photon is correctly detected. To overcome this problem, Briegel, D{\"u}r, Cirac and Zoller (BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters, combining entanglement swapping and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable distances. Although entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated, the implementation of BDCZ quantum repeaters has proved challenging owing to the difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Here we realize entanglement swapping with storage and retrieval of light, a building block of the BDCZ quantum repeater. We follow a scheme that incorporates the strategy of BDCZ with atomic quantum memories. Two atomic ensembles, each originally entangled with a single emitted photon, are projected into an entangled state by performing a joint Bell state measurement on the two single photons after they have passed through a 300-m fibre-based communication channel. The entanglement is stored in the atomic ensembles and later verified by converting the atomic excitations into photons. Our method is intrinsically phase insensitive and establishes the essential element needed to realize quantum repeaters with stationary atomic qubits as quantum memories and flying photonic qubits as quantum messengers.},

We first present various definitions of spin squeezing parameters, explain their origin and properties for typical states, and then discuss spin-squeezed states produced with nonlinear twisting Hamiltonians. Afterward, we explain pairwise correlations and entanglement in spin-squeezed states, as well as the relations between spin squeezing and quantum Fisher information, where the latter plays a central role in quantum metrology. We also review the applications of spin squeezing for detecting quantum chaos and quantum phase transitions, as well as the influence of decoherence on spin squeezing. Finally, we review several experimental realizations of spin squeezing, as well as their corresponding theoretical backgrounds, including: producing spin-squeezed states via particle collisions in Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates, transferring photon squeezing to atomic ensembles, and generating spin squeezing via quantum non-demolition measurements.},

The basic concept of the scheme is that spin coherent states are used instead of qubits to encode qubit information, and manipulated using collective spin operators. The scheme goes beyond the continuous variable regime such that the full space of the Bloch sphere is used. We construct a general framework for quantum algorithms to be executed using multiple spin coherent states, which are individually controlled. We illustrate the scheme by applications to quantum information protocols, and discuss possible experimental implementations. Decoherence effects are analyzed under both general conditions and for the experimental implementation proposed.},

They then map the quantum state of one of the diamond defects onto the other. The work presents a key building block for the successful development of larger quantum networks. Science, this issue p. 532; see also p. 510 A quantum state can now be teleported unconditionally between diamond defects 3 meters apart. [Also see Perspective by Atat√ºre and Morton] Realizing robust quantum information transfer between long-lived qubit registers is a key challenge for quantum information science and technology. Here we demonstrate unconditional teleportation of arbitrary quantum states between diamond spin qubits separated by 3 meters. We prepare the teleporter through photon-mediated heralded entanglement between two distant electron spins and subsequently encode the source qubit in a single nuclear spin. By realizing a fully deterministic Bell-state measurement combined with real-time feed-forward, quantum teleportation is achieved upon each attempt with an average state fidelity exceeding the classical limit. These results establish diamond spin qubits as a prime candidate for the realization of quantum networks for quantum communication and network-based quantum computing.},

In interferometric sensors, they allow us to overcome the ‚Äòclassical‚Äô projection noise limit stemming from the independent nature of the individual photons or atoms within the interferometer. Motivated by the potential impact on metrology as well as by fundamental questions in the context of entanglement, a lot of theoretical and experimental effort has been made to study squeezed states. The first squeezed states useful for quantum-enhanced metrology have been proposed and generated in quantum optics, where the squeezed variables are the coherences of the light field. In this tutorial, we focus on spin squeezing in atomic systems. We give an introduction to its concepts and discuss its generation in Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates. We discuss in detail the experimental requirements necessary for the generation and direct detection of coherent spin squeezing. Two exemplary experiments demonstrating adiabatically prepared spin squeezing based on motional degrees of freedom and diabatically realized spin squeezing based on internal hyperfine degrees of freedom are discussed.},

The general method may be applied to other coherent quantum systems. Science, this issue p. 1552 Manipulation of cold atoms is used for quantum-enhanced precision measurements. Quantum metrology exploits entangled states of particles to improve sensing precision beyond the limit achievable with uncorrelated particles. All previous methods required detection noise levels below this standard quantum limit to realize the benefits of the intrinsic sensitivity provided by these states. We experimentally demonstrate a widely applicable method for entanglement-enhanced measurements without low-noise detection. The method involves an intermediate quantum phase magnification step that eases implementation complexity. We used it to perform squeezed-state metrology 8 decibels below the standard quantum limit with a detection system that has a noise floor 10 decibels above the standard quantum limit.},

Our method is advantageous over the full determination of the density matrix in that it is insensitive to experimental fluctuations in j, and allows for a natural elimination of high-frequency noise in the Wigner function by taking into account the experimental uncertainties in the determination of j, its projection m and the quantization axis orientation. No data binning and no arbitrary smoothing parameters are necessary in this reconstruction. Using recently published data (Riedel et al 2010 Nature 464 1170), we reconstruct the Wigner function of a spin-squeezed state of a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate of about 1250 atoms, demonstrating that measurements along quantization axes lying in a single plane are sufficient for performing this tomographic reconstruction. Our method does not guarantee positivity of the reconstructed density matrix in the presence of experimental noise, which is a general limitation of backprojection algorithms.},

We analyze the two dominant channels of decoherence, atomic dephasing and photon loss on the entangled states produced by this scheme. We calculate the effect of dephasing on the variance and expectation values of the spin operators, entanglement and correlation criteria. Our analysis does not use the Holstein‚ÄìPrimakoff approximation, and is capable of modelling long light‚Äìatom interaction times, producing non-Gaussian states beyond the two-mode squeezed states. In the presence of dephasing, the entangled states are robust in the macroscopic limit as long as the dimensionless interaction time is less than , where N is the number of atoms in the BEC. For photon loss, the entangled states generated by long interaction times show a remarkable robustness that makes the scheme promising for various quantum information applications.},

  abstract = {The transient behavior of the density operator for radiation in a single-mode cavity at a finite temperature is considered. Any initial state will evolve toward thermal equilibrium because of the interaction with the mirrors. This steady state is determined uniquely by the temperature, but the transient state depends on the initial conditions. The equation of motion for the matrix elements of the density operator is solved analytically, given an arbitrary initial state. The factorial moments, the generating function, and the time-dependent spectral distribution are also obtained. The results yield known expressions in the appropriate limits.},

The corresponding Kraus operators from the point of view of quantum channel are derived, whose normalization conditions are proved. Miscellaneous characters possessed by different quantum channels, such as decoherence, phase diffusion, damping, and amplification, can be shown explicitly in the entangled state representation of the density operators. Squeezing transformation is applied to the density operator for decoherence to generate a master equation for describing the phase sensitive process. Partial trace method for deriving new density operators is also introduced. Throughout our discussion, the technique of integration within an ordered product (IWOP) of operators is fully used.},

  abstract = {A state of a quantum-mechanical system is completely described by a density matrix or a phase-space distribution such as the Wigner function. The complete family of squeezed states of light (states that have less uncertainty in one observable than does the vacuum state) have been generated using an optical parametric amplifier, and their density matrices and Wigner functions have been reconstructed from measurements of the quantum statistics of their electric fields. A central theme in many fields of quantum physics is the development and application of theoretical and experimental tools for obtaining information about the states of quantum fields of matter and radiation. Although the state of an individual particle or system is unobservable, it is possible to determine the state of an ensemble of identically prepared systems by performing a large number of measurements 1 ‚Ä¢ Notable experimental succcess has recently been achieved in generating and determining states of various quantum-mechanical systems, employing newly developed methods of quantum state reconstruction (QSR) 2-9 ‚Ä¢ A single mode of light 10-1 4, vibrational modes of a diatomic molecule 15 and of an ion in a Paul trap 16 , and the motional state of freely propagating atoms 17 have been characterized completely by determining their density matrix or, equivalently, their Wigner functions, a quantum-mechanical analogue of the classical phase-space distribution 1 8 ‚Ä¢ A single spatial monochromatic mode of light represents a harmonic oscillator system for which non-classical states can be generated very efficiently using the interaction of laser light with nonlinear optical media. Squeezed states 19 , first generated about ten years ago 20 ‚Ä¢ 21 , have a reduced uncertainty in a specific quadrature (for example the amplitude quadrature) compared to that of the vacuum state. They have typically been characterized by measuring the variances of the electric field with a homodyne detector. A complete investigation of their quantum features, in particular their photon statistics (which at present cannot be measured directly owing to technical limitations of available photon counters) has only become possible through the recent development of theoretical tools for QSR. First experimental investigations analysed coherent and squeezed vacuum states 10 ‚Ä¢ 11 ‚Ä¢ 13 ‚Ä¢ 14 ‚Ä¢ Here we present a study of all types of squeezed states of light; squeezed vacuum, amplitude-squeezed states, phase-squeezed states and states squeezed in an arbitrary quadrature. For each of these states we construct 'portraits' in terms of both the Wigner functions (which are two-dimensional maps in appropriate phase-space coordinates) and the density matrices. These portraits contain all that one can know about the quantum-mechanical properties of the squeezed optical states. Optical homodyne tomography How is the quantum state of an optical wave determined? The measurements to be performed on the state are measurements of the electric field operator E(0) rx X 8 = X cos 0 + Y sin 0 at all phase angles 0. Here X =(a+ at)/V2,, Y = (a-a')!Vli are the non-commuting quadrature operators of the electric field, with a and at being the annihilation and creation operators. X and Y are analogous to position and momentum operators of a particle in a harmonic potential. To access experimentally the electric field, which oscillates with a frequency of w/21r of hundreds of THz, a balanced homodyne detector 22 is employed (see Fig. 1). In this NATURE I VOL 387129 MAY 1997 detector, the signal wave is spatially overlapped at a beamsplitter with a local-oscillator wave of the same frequency. The two fields emerging from the beamsplitter are proportional to the sum and the difference of the signal and local-oscillator fields. By detecting the difference of their fluxes, the natural oscillation of the signal state under investigation is converted to a low-frequency electrical signal i{\_}, which measures Xe, where 0 is the relative phase between signal and local oscillator. A large number of measurements of the observable Xe yields the probability distribution Pe(Xe) of its eigenvalues Xe-This procedure is repeated for a set of different phase angles 0 E [O, 1r]. The relation between the measured distributions and the density operator p is P 8 (x8) = (x I if(0)pU(0) Ix), where U(0) = exp(-i0at a) performs a rotation in phase space. As the optical state evolves freely with w, U is equivalent to the time evolution operator with 0 = wt+ constant, and the 0-dependence of Pe is equivalent to the time dependence of the position probability density of the state (that is, of 1,1,(x, t)l 2 , if p = 1,1,)(,l,},

By considering the interaction of atoms in the 5S1/2(F = 1) ground state with probe light tuned near the D2 transition, we show that, for large detunings, this system is equivalent to a spin-1/2 system when suitable Zeeman substates and quantum operators are used to define a pseudo-spin. The degree of squeezing is derived for the rubidium system in the presence of scattering causing decoherence and loss. We describe how the system can decohere and lose atoms, and predict as much as 75% spin squeezing for atomic densities typical of optical dipole traps.},

The quantum measurement operator takes the form of a positive operator valued measure (POVM) and is valid for arbitrary interaction times, initial coherent state amplitudes, and final photon measurement outcomes. We analyze the dependence on various parameters and show that the effect of the QND measurement for short interaction times is to apply a Gaussian modulation of the initial state wavefunction. We derive approximate expressions for the POVM in various limits, such as the short interaction time regime and projective measurement limit. Several examples are shown, which show how spin squeezing and Schrodinger cat states can be generated using the measurement.}},

Atoms possess properties that suggest clear advantages as self calibrating platforms for measurements of these quantities. In this review, we describe work on a new method for measuring radio frequency (RF) electric fields based on quantum interference using either Cs or Rb atoms contained in a dielectric vapor cell. Using a bright resonance prepared within an electromagnetically induced transparency window it is possible to achieve high sensitivities, &lt;1 ŒºV cm‚àí1 Hz‚àí1/2, and detect small RF electric fields  ŒºV cm‚àí1 with a modest setup. Some of the limitations of the sensitivity are addressed in the review. The method can be used to image RF electric fields and can be adapted to measure the vector electric field amplitude. Extensions of Rydberg atom-based electrometry for frequencies up to the terahertz regime are described.},

Squeezed states could be employed in the next generation of more sensitive advanced detectors currently under construction, such as Advanced LIGO, to further push the limits of the observable gravitational wave Universe. To maximize the benefit from squeezing, environmentally induced disturbances such as back scattering and angular jitter need to be mitigated.

We examine potentially experimentally detrimental effects, such as optical phase diffusion, photon loss and gain, and atomic dephasing. For the optical decoherence channels, we use the technique of integration within ordered operators to obtain the associated Kraus operators. We analyze the effect of different decoherence channels on various quantities, such as the variances of the spin operators, entanglement and correlation criteria, logarithmic negativity, and the Bell‚ÄìCHSH inequality. We generally find a smooth decay of correlations and entanglement in the presence of decoherence. In the short interaction time range, we find that various quantities show signals consistent with, and showing that entanglement exists under all three types of decoherence. Our results show that QND measurements are one of the most promising methods for entanglement generation between two Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates.}},
